%p
  In this screencast, you'll learn how to use 
  %code TorqueBox::Messaging::Backgroundable
  to run tasks on separate, background threads - similar to 
  %code Delayed::Job 
  or Resque.
  This video builds on a 
  %a{:href=>'/podcasts/2011/12/20/sinatra-on-torquebox'} previous screencast 
  by adding DataMapper, Haml, and 
  %code
    TorqueBox::Messaging::Backgroundable 
  to a simple Sinatra application.

  I knew it was going to happen eventually - I've exceeeded my personal 5 minute
  time limit; this screecast runs just at 7 minutes. I hope you'll indulge me.
