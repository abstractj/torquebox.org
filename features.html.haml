      # Rack

      TorqueBox supports [Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/), including [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) 2.3.x, 
      Rails 3.x, [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com), and others.  Rack applications are served 
      as first-class resources within the web container. The web container is clusterable, and web sessions may 
      be shared between nodes without any additional configuration.

      # JDBC
 
      High-performance tried-and-true Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) database drivers power your ActiveRecord and
      other database access.

      # Daemons

      TorqueBox provides the framework to manage your daemon-like Ruby components.  TorqueBox
      makes sure it starts and stops with your application.  What you do in the middle is
      up to you.

      # Scheduled Jobs

      Cron-like functionality is provided by the TorqueBox server. Job classes implemented in Ruby have full access 
      to to your Ruby environment and are managed by a durable job scheduler.

      # Messaging

      Your simple Ruby components can both produce and consume messages from 
      clustered and distributed asynchronous messaging fabric powered by
      [HornetQ](http://hornetq.org/).
  
      # Asynchronous Tasks

      Leveraging the messaging system, TorqueBox makes it easy to execute simple
      tasks and methods asynchronously, allows your application to quickly return
      control to the user.
