On Tuesday, Jan 31st I presented TorqueBox to the [Atlanta JBoss User
Group][ajug] in a talk titled, "When Two Worlds Collide: Java and Ruby
in the Enterprise". There was a good turnout with a few members of the
[Atlanta Ruby User Group][arug] showing up as well.

In case you missed it, we have three ways you can consume the
presentation. The audio on the Ustream recording is a bit quiet so
turn your speakers all the way up or watch the screen capture instead.
