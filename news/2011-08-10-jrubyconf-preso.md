I had a great time presenting at [JRubyConf 2011][jrubyconf] last week. The
conference was a great chance for the TorqueBox team to get to know
some of our users and hopefully attract some new ones. Thanks to
everyone that came out and an even bigger thanks to the organizers for
putting on such a great event!

This was the first time we presented about TorqueBox 2.x so if you
weren't able to make it definitely check out the video and slides. The
conference filmed all the talks so hopefully there will be another
video of my talk on the [JRubyConf][jrubyconf] site soon that we can
link to.
