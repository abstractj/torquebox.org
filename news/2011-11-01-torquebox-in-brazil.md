Our friend and TorqueBox contributor, [Bruno Oliveira], recently
spoke about TorqueBox at [RubyConf Brazil]. I don't speak enough Portugese
to know what all the hubbub was about, but his talk ignited some chatter
on [Twitter] and it seemed to be positive. 

I watched [the video], but even though this conference took place in Brazil
I didn't see any beach parties or Carnivale parades. What's up with that?
Come on now - step it up a bit wouldja, Brazil?

If you don't speak Portugese, you can always take a look at [the slides],
which transcend the language barrier.

Thanks for spreading the love, Bruno!
