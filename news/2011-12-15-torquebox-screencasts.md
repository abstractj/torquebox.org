# TorqueBox 2.x Screencasts

As people who work on TorqueBox every day, we love it and think it's a great
application platform. And because we work on it every day, we sometimes forget
how nice it can be for the community to have a short, simple introduction to 
basics like installation of the server and running a rails app. So with that
in mind, we're offering 2 short screencasts to help new users get up and 
running on what we think is one of the best Ruby deployment platforms around.

* [Installing TorqueBox 2.0](http://vimeo.com/33299335)
* [Getting Started With Rails Apps on TorqueBox](http://vimeo.com/33417394)

I hope you find them useful. And if you would like to see more, let us know what
topics you are interested in. We have a number of other screencasts to produce
and releas in the coming weeks -- community input is always welcome!
