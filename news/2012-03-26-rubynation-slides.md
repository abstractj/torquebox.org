Friday, the 24th of March was a beautiful day in Reston, VA, and the
crowds at [RubyNation] were enjoying the first day of the conference.

Around 1:40pm, I (Bob) took the stage in room #2 to present the
presentation that [Lance Ball] and I had prepared, based upon his
work in moving an application from a PaaS (Heroku) to TorqueBox.

Below are the slides, as presented.  I'd like to thank the RubyNation
organizers for giving us the opportunity to present about TorqueBox.
