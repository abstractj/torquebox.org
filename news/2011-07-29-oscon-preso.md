Earlier this week, I had the pleasure of presenting TorqueBox to an audience of 
Java developers at [OSCON Java](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/content/java) 
in beautiful [Portland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon) (no, the other one). 
[Bob](http://twitter.com/#!/bobmcwhirter) was 
scheduled to go but was unable to make it, so I subbed in at the last minute.

I wish I could have stayed longer and talked with more folks, but it was a whirlwind trip.

Here are my slides from that presentation for the enjoyment of all:
