Members of both the TorqueBox team and the community will be speaking about 
TorqueBox in a variety of places in the coming month or so.  While we keep a
list on the [front page of the site](/), we figured it would be good to call
them out explicitly.

In chronological order...

# Bruno Oliveira (abstractj) 
## 23 July 
### GURU-SP, Sao Paulo, Brazil

Bruno (better known in the community as `abstractj`) will be presenting
**TorqueBox: o melhor dos dois mundos**, which translates either into
"TorqueBox: my shoes are too tight" or "TorqueBox: the best in the world".

# Bob McWhirter
## 25 July, 3:30pm
### OSCon Java, Portland, Oregon

I (Bob) will be presenting **TorqueBox: The Beauty of Ruby with the Power of Java**
next Monday at OSCon Java.  My goal is to demonstrate to the Java audience that 
Ruby can be beautiful and fun, without having to give up your enterprise goodness.

Lance will be presenting **TorqueBox: A True Application Server for Ruby** at
the Hoedown.  Lance will be convincing a room full of Rubyists that a Java-based
solution can bring about great benefit.
