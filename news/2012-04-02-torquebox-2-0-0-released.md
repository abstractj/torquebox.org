## What is TorqueBox?

TorqueBox is a Ruby application server built on JBoss AS7 and JRuby.  In
addition to being one of the [fastest Ruby servers around][BENchmarks], it supports
Rack-based web frameworks, and provides [simple Ruby interfaces][features] to
standard JavaEE services, including *scheduled jobs*, *caching*, *messaging*,
and *services*.

## What's special about 2.0.0?

This is the 2.0.0 *final* release, which is a *major*
upgrade over TorqueBox 1.x.  Notable inclusions in 2.0.0 include:

* JRuby 1.6.7 (with better Ruby 1.9 support)
* JBoss AS 7.1.1 (faster boot time, smaller memory footprint)
* [Multi-resource distributed XA transactions][XA]
* [WebSockets/STOMP][STOMP]
* Considerable [speed & memory improvements][BENchmarks] over 1.x

## What's changed since cr1?

We fixed a handful of issues reported against cr1, and gave our documentation an 
overhaul. Highlights in this release include:

* A brand-spankin-new [production setup guide]
* A chapter in the documentation covering [application deployment]
* Jobs & Services are now singleton by default - if you are running in a cluster 
  and were relying on Jobs and Services running on every node by default, you'll need 
  to turn off singleton support by setting `singleton: false` for each Job or Service.

## How do I migrate from 1.x to 2.0.0?

The biggest changes you'll see will be around any xml configuration changes you
have made to the underlying JBoss AS server. TorqueBox 1.x was based on AS6, and
2.x is based on AS7, which is considerably different than AS6. Any changes you'll
need to make to your application code and configuration should be minimal, if any.
We plan on writing migration guide sometime in the next couple of weeks. In the 
meantime, read through the [documentation][htmldocs], give it a try, and 
[bug us][community] if you have any questions or problems.

## Thanks to an outstanding community

Thanks to everyone that helped us with patches, bug reports, and generally good natured
support as we went through this major rewrite over the last 11 months. You guys are
great! Without you, there would just be us :)
