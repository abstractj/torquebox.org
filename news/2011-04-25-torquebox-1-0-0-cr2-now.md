Our schedule originally called for 1.0.0.CR2 to be released on Friday, 22 April, but we
then realized that was a holiday.  We considered releasing a day early but just weren't feeling
it.  Which was good, because Amazon broke on Thursday.  We perform our builds and releases on
EC2.

So, today, 25 April, TorqueBox 1.0.0.CR2 is available.  Go [download it][download] and [read the documentation][docs].
Heck, maybe even read the documentation in [ePub][epub] format on your electronic reading device.

Trying to keep to a pure CR release cycle, this release includes no new features, but
a small handful of bug-fixes, including solving some resource-leaks.

Here's what we've done since the CR1 release on 15 April:


<ul>
