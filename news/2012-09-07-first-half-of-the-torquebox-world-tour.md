In August, I had the honor of presenting TorqueBox at two great conferences 
outside of our usual stomping grounds: [JRubyConf EU](http://jrubyconf.eu/) 
in Berlin, Germany and [RubyConf Brasil](http://www.rubyconf.com.br/) in 
Sao Paulo, Brasil.


## JRubyConf EU

JRubyConf EU was part of the larger [eurucamp](http://2012.eurucamp.org/) conference, 
and was held at a [beautiful spot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCggelsee). This 
was the first european JRubyConf, and was put together on extremely short notice. 
In spite of that, it was well run, and the presentations were top notch. If you get
a chance, thank [Alex Coles](https://twitter.com/myabc) and 
[Florian Gilcher](https://twitter.com/Argorak) for all of their hard work.

My talk was titled *Simplify Your Infrastructure With TorqueBox*, and was mostly a
live-coding demonstration where I added TorqueBox features to an application. 
It wasn't recorded, unfortunately, so you'll have to make do with the 
[scant slides](https://speakerdeck.com/u/tobias/p/jrubyconf-eu-2012-simplify-your-infrastructure-with-torquebox).

I've also posted [the code from the live demo](https://github.com/tobias/jrubyconfeu-demo), 
but it won't make much sense if you didn't see the talk. 

Luckily, my RubyConf Brasil talk *was* recorded, and has similar content!

## RubyConf Brasil

This was (I believe) the fifth year for RubyConf Brasil, and 
[Fabio Akita](http://twitter.com/akitaonrails) has gotten it to the point where it
works like a well-oiled machine. I was especially impressed by the live translation
services for every talk into either Portuguese or English, and by the quality of
all of the talks. I was also impressed by the friendliness of the Brazilian ruby 
community - I had lots of great conversations. It probably helped that I was hanging
out with [@qmx](http://twitter.com/qmx) and [@abstractj](http://twitter.com/abstractj) - 
I think between the two of them, they know everyone in Brasil.

My talk was titled *Simple Scalability With JRuby & TorqueBox*, and was an expanded
version (by about 20 minutes) of my JRubyConf EU talk. Since this talk was recorded,
I recommend you [watch it](http://www.eventials.com/rubyconfbr2012/recorded/M2UzZTJkMzY2MzdiNTg2NTUxNWM1MzI3NWY1YjRhMzYjIzEzMDU_3D) instead of just looking at the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/u/tobias/p/simple-scalability-with-jruby-and-torquebox). After you've watched the talk, 
you can download and play with the [code from the demo](https://github.com/tobias/rubyconfbr-demo) if you are so inclined.

## The tour continues!

Be on the lookout for Ben's report from the second half of the TorqueBox 
World Tour - he'll be presenting at [Devoxx](http://devoxx.com/) in Antwerp, 
Belgium and [RuPy](http://rupy.eu/) in Brno, Czech Republic in November.
