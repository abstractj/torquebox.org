Last night I went down to the 
[Queen City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina) and presented
TorqueBox to the great group of folks at [Charlotte.rb](http://www.meetup.com/charlotte-rb/).
I appreciate them having me down, and for putting up
with the live demo demons.

Someone (was it you, [Jim](http://twitter.com/#!/bigfleet)?) asked about
dealing with errors when a scheduled job fails - I've filed a feature
request ([TORQUE-420](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/TORQUE-420)) for that.

The twitter stream demo app I built is [available on github](https://github.com/tobias/torquebox-tweetwatch),
and I've posted the slides for the enjoyment of all:
