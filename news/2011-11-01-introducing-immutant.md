[Immutant]: http://immutant.org

Since it's the first day of the only month starting with the letter N,
we decided to officially announce the birth of the [Immutant] project,
so hop on over there and read all about it.

TorqueBox started its life because Bob wanted to do Ruby. Well, Toby
and I want to do Clojure. :)

One day, we'll completely expose the JBoss AS awesomeness to any
JVM-based language. We would love for you to help us get there!
