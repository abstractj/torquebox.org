Since it's the first day of the only month starting with the letter N,
we decided to officially announce the birth of the [Immutant] project,
though we've been working on it for a few weeks now.

TorqueBox started its life because Bob wanted to do Ruby. Well, Toby
and I want to do Clojure. :)

Here's the official [announcement].

The JBoss AS is awesome. TorqueBox exposes that awesomeness to
Ruby. And it provides us a model to do the same for Clojure. Once
done, we can seamlessly integrate your Ruby and Clojure
components. And then we'll bring in other JVM languages...

I think you see where this is going.

Good, because at this point, we're not entirely sure ourselves, so
come help us with it! ;)
