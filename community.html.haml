        Being an open-source project, the TorqueBox community has many entry-points.  You're
        welcome to participate via one or several, depending on your level of interest.
  
      %p
        Some activities, like filing bugs in our <a href="/community/issues/">issue tracker</a>, require
        that you have a JBoss Community account.  <a href="https://community.jboss.org/login.jspa">Signing up for a JBoss Community account</a> is 
        easy.

          The TorqueBox team is a distributed team, so you can be
          as close to the action as anyone else by participating 
          on IRC.  IRC is our virtual office (and virtual watercooler)
          so fire up an IRC client and stop in.

          The team maintains two mailing lists.  The <code>-user</code> list
          is tailored for people who just want to effectively use TorqueBox.
    
        %p 
          The <code>-dev</code> list is intended for individuals who want to
          know what's going on under the hood.

          If you say something nice about TorqueBox, chances are we'll retweet you.
          If you say something incomprehensible (to us) in a foreign language,
          we will also probably still retweet you.  Then ask for a translation.
